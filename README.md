Within this repo are the files used to create a new `geom_*` used by the
`ggplot2` package to visualize the wind speeds associated with
hurricanes. Functions are included for reading, cleaning, and outputting
hurricane data based on user specified hurricane name and datetime
point. Examples are provided for hurricane Katrina and hurricane Ike.

## Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina was an Atlantic hurricane made landfall in
Buras-Triumph, Louisiana on August 29, 2005 at approximately 6:10 am CDT
as a category 3 storm.

### Data setup and cleaning

``` r
#summary(cars)
```

### geom_hurricane figure

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub.

## Hurricane Ike

Hurricane Ike was an Atlantic hurricane that made landfall first in Cuba
then in Galveston, Texas on September 13, 2008 at approximately 2:10 am
CDT as a category 2 storm.
